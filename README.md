This research was carried out to know the impact of Covid-19 on the USA Air pollution and Food Insecurities.

## Introduction

Since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the global pandemic known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on society and daily life, beginning in 2019 and intensifying significantly from 2020 to the foreseeable in ways that haven't been seen in recent years.
